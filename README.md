### City Model

1. Let's add some fields to our `City` model that represents the country that's selling this city.

   ```javascript
   {
       name: {
         type: String,
         required: false
       },
       countryName: {
         type: String,
         required: false
       },
       countryImage: {
         type: String,
         required: false
       },
     },

   ```

2. Does this make sense? To add those fields to the `City` model? A country can have 100 different Cities, does that mean that those fields will be repeated in all 100 rows?! Nonsense! What we need to do is create a `Country` model, then link it to the `City` model.

3. Let's start by creating a file called `Country.js` in the `models` folder.

4. Create your model and move the relevant fields from `City`:

   ```javascript
   const CountrySchema = new Schema({
     name: String,
     image: String,
   });
   ```

5. Setup your slug by `require`ing `mongoose-slug-plugin`

   ```javascript
   const mongooseSlugPlugin = require("mongoose-slug-plugin");
   ```

6. **Right before returning** `Country`, set your slug source to `name`.

   ```javascript
     const CountrySchema = new Schema({
        ...
       });

   CountrySchema.plugin(mongooseSlugPlugin, { tmpl: '<%=name%>' });

   module.exports = model('Country', CountrySchema);
   };
   ```

### Country Routes

1. Let's create list and create methods for our countries! The easiest way to do this is to copy the `cityController` and `city` route and change the naming.

2. Then in `app.js`, create a route for the country routes:

   ```javascript
   const countryRoutes = require("./apis/countries/routes");
   ```

   ```javascript
   app.use("/countries", countryRoutes);
   ```

### City Has a Country

1. Now let's create the relationship between our two models, `City` and `Country`. Let's think about it, every country can have _many_ cities, but every city can have _one_ country only.

2. We will define our relationships first in `models/Country.js` as a field. Let's translate the following phrase to code "A country has many cities". So our country has a field of type array because it `hasMany` cities.

   ```javascript
   const CountrySchema = new Schema({
     name: String,
     image: String,
     cities: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "City" }],
   });
   ```

3. Next, We will define our relationships from the other side in `models/City.js`:

   ```javascript
   const CitySchema = new Schema({
     name: String,
     image: String,
     country: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Country" },
   });
   ```

4. Then let's add some cities, note that a field called `country` was added! Let's try this in Postman. Fetch all `cities`. The field `country` is there, but it's set to `empty`.

### CityCreate Betrays Cities

So now whenever we create a new city we need to add the country \_id. The easiest way to do that is to pass the country \_id in the request body. But that's not the correct convention, we agreed before that IDs are passed in the request's URL.

1. So we will change our `createCity` route to `/countries/:countryId/cities`. Since it starts with `countries`, we will move the `createCity` route and controller to the country's routes and controllers files.

2. Since `createCity` has `countryId` as a route param, we will save it in `req.body` before passing it to `City.create`.

   ```javascript
   try {
       [...]
       req.body.country = req.params.countryId;
       const newCity = await City.create(req.body);
       [...]
     }
   ```

3. Then, we will add the new City to its own country using mongoose `$push` query which adds an element in an array

```javascript
await Country.findOneAndUpdate(
  { _id: req.params.countryId },
  { $push: { cities: newCity._id } }
);
```

4. Let's try creating another city, Wowwwww!!! Amaaazinng!

### Country List

1. Let's fetch the list of countries in Postman. Okay, nothing special about it. But what if we can add to every country the list of its cities!

2. To do that we will pass it to a function called `populate()` and pass it your field:

   ```javascript
   Country.find().populate("cities");
   ```

3. Test. Yaas all is working properly!!

### City List

We'll fix our cities list to return all cities, but to also add the country's name to display it in the city list.

1. Now let's include the country details in the cities list! In `cityController`:

   ```javascript
   City.find().populate("country");
   ```

2. Let's try fetching our list of cities again. It works!
